# EOS Congester

This is the source code of the script that I used in October 2019 to congest EOS mainnet. EOS was ranked top7 by coinmarketcap at that moment. My attack caused EOS mainnet to freeze for almost a month.

Here is an article that describes the attack: https://www.eosgo.io/blog/Eos-network-congestion-by-ddos-analysis/

Here is my announcement of the attack: https://twitter.com/dexaran/status/1179071416764960768?lang=bg
